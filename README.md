# Hangman Game

### Description

A game in which you guess a random string of letters to make the correct word to win. If you get a letter wrong, a part or limb of the stick figure will be added for each time you guess wrong. If you guess the right letter, the letter would be in the line in the correct order so you can improve chances of winning.
